## Tech Reasoning

### MVVM
The **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)** architecture is implemented to maintain a clean and testable codebase. However, given the scope of this project, the architecture has been kept as simple as possible to avoid unnecessary complexity.

### UserDefaults
**UserDefaults** is used as a data cache in this project due to the nature of the data being storedâ€”small and lightweight (e.g., 10 search queries). Unlike **NSCache**, **UserDefaults** provides reliable persistence as it is not purged under memory pressure. Additionally, its simplicity makes it an ideal choice for this use case.

### Framework
I use SwiftLint to maintain code readability and ensure a clean codebase. No additional frameworks were added to minimize dependencies on third-party libraries, keeping the app lightweight and easier to maintain.

### UI Design
The search text field is positioned at the bottom of the screen, inspired by Safari's design, making it more ergonomic and easier for thumbs to reach. When the app starts or no data is available, the text field moves to the center of the screen to draw the user's attention and emphasize its purpose.

## Trade-offs

### MVVM
While simplifying MVVM reduced architectural complexity, it also introduced challenges, such as making the codebase less clean and harder to scale for larger features or future expansions.

### UserDefaults
Although **UserDefaults** works well for small data, it lacks memory management and can become inefficient if the amount of data stored grows significantly.

## Future Improvements

### Remote Data Source
Refactor the remote data source service to be more generic and adaptable, enabling support for multiple endpoints and model targets.

### Layering
Refactor the codebase to introduce proper separation between low-level and high-level layers. Ensure dependencies between these layers are loosely coupled to create a clean, maintainable, reusable, and testable architecture.

### Caching
Implement a more robust and appropriate caching mechanism for better performance and scalability.

### Error Handling and Retry Logic
Enhance error handling mechanisms and introduce retry logic for API requests to improve reliability and user experience.

### UI Enhancements
Work on improving the user interface by adding smoother animations and creating more user-friendly interactions.
